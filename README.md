# Maven Airlines Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## Challenge Objective

As a Senior Data Analyst for Maven Airlines, your task is to analyze the latest passenger survey data to identify key areas for improvement. The satisfaction rate has dipped below 50% for the first time ever, and the leadership team needs a data-driven strategy to increase this rate. Your goal is to recommend actionable strategies based on your analysis and present your findings in a single-page report or dashboard.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of passenger satisfaction with Maven Airlines. The dashboard includes key metrics such as the total number of passengers, average flight distance, and average arrival and departure delays. It also offers insights into various factors affecting passenger satisfaction, including class, customer type, travel type, food and drink options, onboard service, gender, cleanliness, check-in service, and seat comfort. By analyzing these factors, the dashboard helps identify areas for improvement to enhance the overall passenger experience.

## About the Dataset

The dataset contains satisfaction ratings from over 120,000 airline passengers, along with additional details about each passenger's flight, travel type, and evaluations of various factors such as cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.

## Recommended Analysis

The analysis aims to address the following questions:
1. What is the percentage of satisfied airline passengers, and does it differ by customer type or type of travel?
2. What are the characteristics of a frequent airline passenger's customer profile?
3. Does flight distance impact customer preferences or travel behavior?
4. Which factors have the most significant impact on customer satisfaction, and which ones lead to dissatisfaction?
